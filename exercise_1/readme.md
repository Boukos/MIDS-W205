# Hospital comparisons based on Medicare data

The [Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Hospital Compare]() project addresses the issue of comparing hospitals across the United 
States based on hospital evaluation surveys.

More specifically, we wish to answer the following questions:

1. What hospitals are models of high-quality care? That is, which hospitals have the most consistently high scores for a variety of procedures.
2. What states are models of high-quality care?
3. Which procedures have the greatest variability between hospitals?
4. Are average scores for hospital quality or procedural variability correlated with patient survey responses?

In order to answer these questions, we need to [load](/loading_and_modelling/) the [data](https://data.medicare.gov/data/hospital-compare) into a data lake,
[transforming](/transforming/) it to an appropriate format which allows the [analysis](/investigations) of the data.
